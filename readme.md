## Cook-Webpack

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kalcifer/cook-webpack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kalcifer/cook-webpack)

`webpack` configuration is hard to construct. This is a well acknowledged problem. 

## Vision

Its ambitious but this project aims to provide an graphical interface to build your webpack config. The vision is to have a project based on codemirror and webpack validator to make config building easy for you.

18/10/2016 - Setup deku and a testable surface. Copied webpack schema.

21/10/2016 - entry part schema half decoded along with tests. Needs tests for individual models

01/11/2016 - Moved to nextjs as was facing issues with new deku and redux.

02/11/2016 - Added more schema props and made a selectable interface.

04/11/2016 - Added linting and travis build to the project.

### TODO
Design each component better
